    "__II. GEO-LOCATION DATA SOURCES AND ACQUISITION__\n",
    "\n",
    "_1. General location_\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we gather the location information about both cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cities are shown on the maps to analyse the geographical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result we can conclude, the location of both cities make it easy for Prof. Kowalski to pursue his sailing activities.\n",
    "Seattle is located on the shores of Puget Sound while\n",
    "Vancouver lies on Georgia Strait\n",
    "areas known among sailors as very intersting and demanding.\n",

    "\n",
    "_2. Administrative division and clustering_\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyse the socio-cultural offerings of both cities it is necessary to find the location of the most interesting venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point the data base of the postal codes was taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a publicly available full register of all postal codes in the US and Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering the codes of Vancouver and Seattle gave back still enormous database without the connection of the code to the name of the neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a different approach has been assumed, gather the information about neighbourhoods from the sites of Seattle and Vancouver municipalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such gathered data was augmented by the information from Google Maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such gathered data was prepared in the form of a csv-file and uploaded to the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result the dataframes containing the information on neighbourhoods in Seattle and Vancouver were createtd.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighbourhoods were clustered and presented in relation to the Universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the cluster lying the nearest vicinity to the future worplace will be the central point for data sourcing from Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Foursquare profile we will import the information about the venues in both cities and analyse them regarding prof. Kowalski's personal preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__III. DETAILED VENUE DATA AND ANALYSIS OF DATASETS__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data from Foursquare ###\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the data from Foursquare the centres of particular centroids were chosen with the radius of 1000 m.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the datasets received for both, Seattle and Vancouver only the venues of the particular type were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account he interests of our fictitious character we analysed the number of venues of particular type in the set vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find the tables summarising the result of the survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculation of the result of the first approach we assumed the weights for the particular areas of interest of prof. Kowalski as below:\n",

    "__IV.VERIFICATION OF THE DATA QUALITY__\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the above analysis Prof. Kowalski was very supprised with the modesty of the socio-cultural offer of both cities.\n",
    "He compares the offer of Seattle and Vancouver to what he can find in the Tri-City area (Gdańsk-Sopot-Gdynia) where he leaves now (approx. 700 thousand inhabitants).\n",
    "There are more thetres, an opera, the philharmony and numerous museums and galleries. There are many events even off-season.\n",
    "Notwithstanding, the very sailor-friendly Gulf of Gdańsk and Southern Baltic Sea.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to compare the quality of the data source, Prof. Kowalski decided to perform the analysis for his home town.\n",
    "This way he will be able to see how \"filtering\" the limits imposed by Foursquare really are.\n",
    "\n",
    "__GDANSK__\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof.Kowalski repeted the whole procedure for his home-town, i.e.\n",
    "1. he imported geo location data for the neighbourhoods (Wiki, gdansk.pl, Google Maps)\n",
    "2. Clustered the neighbourhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing his home-town he would rather change the clustering in regard to Śródmieście-Główne Miasto neighbourhood.\n",
    "This is so called \"Old Town\", a main historic centre of Gdańsk rich in historic and cultural venues and it was clustered together with the industrial districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at this moment we are testing the influence of the limits imposed by Foursquare and not the results of clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sourcing and analysing the data from Foursquare__\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the analysis it turned out that the socio-cultural offering of Gdańsk in not much better than the offering of Seattle.\n",

    "__V. CONCLUSION__\n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing on the gathered data the conclusiuon is prety obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "the rankiing shows that Vancouver gathered 2.04 points while Seattle - 1.37. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vancouver is, therefore, a better choice than Seattle assuming everything else being equal, especially academic opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore Prof. Kowalski should accept the proposal from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The dicision will be easier to make as the comparison with his home-town showed the advantage of Vancouver over Gdańsk, too.\n",
    "Knowing Gdańsk and its socio-cultural life, in Prof. Kowalski's opinion the data from Foursquare does not show the full potential of the city of Gdańsk. This same conclusion must be applied also to both contenders, i.e. the results must be deemed acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "__VI. Obserwations__\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains venue data for the radius r=1000 m.\n",
    "But the test was done with the radius r=2500 m in an attempt to widen the area in search for POIs. The results received were the same as in the case of radius r=1000 m. Increasing the radius did not bringthe expected results as the limit on number of venues is 100 and cannot be increased and is the main limiting factor for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__VII. PRESENTATION__\n",
    "\n",
    "_The project will be presented inthe form of the_ __.ppt__ _presentation and posted to my github where it will be publicly accessible._"
