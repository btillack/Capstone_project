    "This was a surprise to Prof. Kowalski because he is abreast of the cultural events taking place in Gdańsk and knows most of the cultural venues of the types used in this analysis. In his opinion Gdańsk should have gathered much more points but he observed the following shortcomings of the data set:\n",
    "- the list did not contain OPERA as a separate category,\n",
    "- CINEMAs, non-existent and although the cinematic multiplexes are usually parts of the shopping malls, there are still indepenent one-hall (studio) cinemas in Gdańsk,\n",
    "- his prefered venues - MARINAs - are located on the Eastern part of the city farther then 1 km from the city-centre.\n",

    "__V. CONCLUSION__\n",

    "### Therefore Prof. Kowalski should accept the proposal from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision will be easier to make as the comparison with his home-town showed the advantage of Vancouver over Gdańsk, too.\n",
    "Knowing Gdańsk and its socio-cultural life, in Prof. Kowalski's opinion the data from Foursquare does not show the full potential of the city of Gdańsk. This same conclusion must be applied also to both contenders, i.e. the results must be deemed acceptable.\n",

    "This notebook contains venue data for the radius r=1000 m.\n",
    "But the test was done with the radius r=2500 m in an attempt to widen the area in search for POIs. The results received were the same as in the case of radius r=1000 m. Increasing the radius did not bringthe expected results as the limit on number of venues is 100 and cannot be increased and is the main limiting factor for this analysis.\n",
